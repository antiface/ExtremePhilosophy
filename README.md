### Extreme Philosophy
* Extreme Philosophy is a form of design philosophy and information philosophy;
* In essence, it is the philosophy of extremes;
* In analogy to "flash fiction", extreme philosophy can be called "flash philosophy";
* The basic idea, though, is to move away from the extremities, slowly panning through the spectrum of various theoretical scan-paths, away from "in extremis" ("in the farthest reaches") more towards "in media res" ("into the middle of things");
* Think of it as moving beyond continually-deferred mediation of the immediate to attain a kind of subtle fusion of many distant points, always incomplete, unfinished, asymmetric, irregular-shaped, & patternless and forever Elsewhere, but closer to the "unmediated intermediacy" of living in the world than the exponential abstract formalization of most previously proposed new logics;
* In that sense, rather than being an Abstract Realism as now and before, it proposes a Concrete Realism; We call it The New Clockwork, or New Organon;
* Thinking is hard, thoughts fuse together, are easily defused, are diffuse, are over- and under-used, lack variety, variegation, are often repetitive, dull, abstruse, and most often than not, indeterminate; (and to have too much faith in our "thoughtful" machinations makes us "trusted" fools of an Anaesthetic Beauty); (a.k.a. "Beautiful Signals");
* Both the future of positive-feedback-induced, exponential abstract formalization is grim; all subtleties are lost, eternal sameness, lukewarmness, is the norm; it is the folly of infinite progress; it erases all true - or useful - differentiation, is its own derivative; and it defies any and all real Integration;
* If all is in constant Movement, Universe is the perpetuum mobile; but the mean is almost always Zero; (Enter The Anti-Zero, All Mediation is Non-Zero Sum, And Hence The Problem; Only The Mean is True To Perpetual Unmediated Intermediacy of Universe);
