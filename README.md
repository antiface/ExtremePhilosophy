### Extreme Philosophy
* Extreme Philosophy is a form of design philosophy and information philosophy;
* In essence, it is the philosophy of extremes;
* In analogy to "flash fiction", extreme philosophy can be called "flash philosophy";
* The basic idea, though, is to move away from the extremities, slowly panning through the spectrum of various theoretical scan-paths, away from "in extremis" ("in the farthest reaches") more towards "in media res" ("into the middle of things");
* Think of it as moving beyond continually-deferred mediation of the immediate to attain a kind of subtle fusion of many distant points, always incomplete, unfinished, forever Elsewhere, but closer to the "unmediated intermediacy" of living in the world than the exponential abstract formalization of most previously proposed new logics;
* In that sense, rather than being an Abstract Realism, it is a Concrete Realism;
* Thinking is hard, thoughts fuse together, are easily defused, are diffuse, are over- and under-used, lack variety, variegation, are often repetitive, dull, abstruse, and most often than not, indeterminate;
* Both the future of positive-feedback-induced, exponential abstract formalization is grim; all subtleties are lost, eternal sameness, lukewarmness, is the norm; it is the folly of infinite progress; it erases all true - or useful - differentiation, is its own derivative;
