### Extreme Philosophy
* Extreme Philosophy is a form of design philosophy and information philosophy;
* In essence, it is the philosophy of extremes;
* In analogy to "flash fiction", extreme philosophy can be called "flash philosophy";
* The basic idea, though, is to move away from the extremities, slowly panning through the spectrum of various theoretical scan-paths, away from "in extremis" ("in the farthest reaches") more towards "in media res" ("into the middle of things");
